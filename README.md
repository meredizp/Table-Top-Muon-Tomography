# Table-Top-Muon-Tomography Experiment
Documentation for building the open source Cost Effective Table-Top Muon Tomography Experiment at Utrecht University

Muography (or muon tomography) is an imaging technique that uses cosmic muons—high-energy particles produced when cosmic rays interact with Earth's atmosphere—to create detailed images of the interior of objects. Muons are highly penetrating, much like X-rays but at much higher energies, allowing them to pass through thick and dense materials, such as mountains, buildings, or industrial structures.

## Experiment Goal
This thesis aims to explore the early development stage of a table top, cost-effective, muon tomography scanner through the use of photomultiplier tubes and organic scintillators. By establishing a proof-of-concept, the experiment suggests pathways for further development, potentially expanding the applications of muon imaging in research, education, and low-budget experimental environments. The performance of the scanner is validated through multi-hour test scans using known densities. Final results are documented in preparation for future adaptations of the experiment.
