# Muon Tomography Experiment Operation
This section will explain the logic of, and how to operate, the muon tomography experiment. 

This is broken into components for clarity:
  - [ ] [Arduino](../OperationalInstructions/Arduino.md) logic and wiring.
  - [ ] [Oscilloscope](./Oscilloscope.md) logging logic
  - [ ] Preliminary [Analysis](./ROOTanalysis.md) of collected data
