## Basic Logic
The main logic of the system depends on muon coincidences and a pseudo arduino pulse. To begin, for a coincidence to be measured, the two PMTs mounted on the scanning arms must both trigger with a muon pulse. Once this occurs the data from each PMT mounted on the plate scintillator is saved by the oscilloscope. The scanning arms sit at a location for a specified amount of time then move to the next grid location. The data is separated by grid location through the use of the arduino that moves the stepper motors.
