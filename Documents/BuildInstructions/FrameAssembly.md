# Frame Assembly
This section will explain the design considerations for the development of the muon scanner. Design influences drawn from Computer Numeric Control (CNC) machining methods to PMT calibrations are utilized with the aid of rapid prototyping methods, such as Fused Deposition Modelling (FMD).
